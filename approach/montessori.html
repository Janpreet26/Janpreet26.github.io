We strongly believe that each child is innately good, so we look to our children for guidance on how we should treat each other and our environment.</span>

            <span>Order and structure, as both enable an object to understand and make sense of itself in relation to its environment. This awareness is essential for a child to feel secure within its environment and to build on existing experiences. Order in our classrooms help our children feel safe and understand how things should be.</span>

Children are natural learners with an impulse to take joy in the process and not the end result. So we believe our role is to provide open and adventurous environments in which the children can become wonderfully dynamic, natural learners. Restricting a child's natural impulse can stop a child from enjoying learning, which often happens during school.</span>

        The Montessorian's Approach
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The Montessori approach can be summarised as an environment prepared specifically to meet the needs of the child's stage of development. The environment is coupled with an adult that guides each child to find their natural path of development.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Within this space there are very few limits to the child's freedom and decision-making. Children freely interact with their prepared environment, taking an activity and interacting with it until they find a satisfactory outcome, and putting their activity away.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Through detailed observations of a child's choice and use of activities, a teacher can guide the child further by adding activities and increasing the range of materials to explore. Each child takes ownership of their time, deciding when to be active, when to rest and watch, when to look at a book, to go outside, to have a drink or prepare a healthy snack.  When a child is free to choose within this environment, we can observe their interests unfold and follow these natural impulses to support their development.

          Our Goals
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Extensive research has shown that a child's sensitive periods during their first five years directly impact their adolescent
          physical, behavioural and cognitive development. It is during this period that we can have the biggest impact on a person's life and our goal at Montessorians is to provide the best possible start to life for all of our children.
  Central to this is promoting independence for our children to pursue their natural impulses and encouraging their enjoyment.

              <span>For a child to become independent they need to be in an environment that makes them feel capable, respected and supported. Showing a child how to do things and giving them unlimited opportunities to play. This is vital to a child developing the necessary manipulative skills and concentration through with practical life and sensorial activities. Repetition is essential for a child to become competent in skills such as dressing, cooking and personal hygiene. These self-care skills serve as an essential foundation for a child to excel in more academic learning.</span>

              <span>Each child has a natural impulse to try, explore and repeat. So we believe our role is to provide open and engaging environments in which the children can become wonderfully dynamic, natural learners. We encourage our children to follow their natural impulse, celebrating the process of learning, and not the end result. We believe in  a child centred self-directed learning, where children are free to explore materials, activities, rest and play cooperatively.  In this way our children become self-motivated learners, extremely adept at deconstructing concepts and creating.</span>

              <span>Each of our nurseries has Montessori and Early Years Teachers, providing the settings with a sweet spot for using the best methodologies from each curriculum and teaching style. This gives our teachers the advantage of not being entrenched in a particular Pedagogy, allowing our settings to introduce teaching methods and tools based on scientific research. Using research and our own experience, we introduce these tools into the classrooms supporting the staff and children.</span>
